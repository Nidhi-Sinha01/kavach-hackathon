ABSTRACT
Our project focuses on the development of a platform for fund trailing analysis that 
is capable of detecting various forms of illicit financial activities such as money 
laundering, fraud, terrorist financing, and compliance monitoring. The project 
involves the collection of financial data from various sources, including bank 
statements and transaction logs, and its organization in a manner that enables the 
observation of trends and connections between transactions.
Data analysis is carried out on the structured data using a range of methodologies 
such as data mining and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and linkages. These 
patterns are then used to identify potential fraudulent or suspicious activity. The 
project involves extensive investigation into suspicious transactions to determine 
the source of the money and the nature of the transaction.
We have developed a model that is trained on extensive data, allowing it to identify 
anomalies and patterns that may indicate suspicious financial activity. Our model 
not only investigates and seizes detected malicious bank accounts but also 
identifies corresponding resembling accounts and freezes them until further 
investigation is completed.
The project involves dealing with various challenges, including data availability, 
data quality, data processing, data storage, compliance regulations, expertise, and
collaboration. Despite these challenges, our platform has significant potential for 
business applications. It can be implemented with central banking systems or 
national economy controlling systems to combat corruption and significantly 
reduce the fund trail. Furthermore, it can be scaled to work with high-security 
potential and blockchain technology.
